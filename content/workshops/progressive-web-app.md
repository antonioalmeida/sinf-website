Progressive Web Apps use modern web capabilities to deliver fast, native-app experiences with no app stores or downloads, and all the goodness of the web. In this workshop you will learn how to improve any web application and transform it into a working Progressive Web App. 

To accomplish this you will learn how to use the Lighthouse Tool to evaluate if your web application meets the standards of a PWA. We will teach you how to create a manifest file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on a mobile device. You will improve the first page load by caching the relevant request using a service worker. Finally, you will increase the user engagement by implementing push notifications.
